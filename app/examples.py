    "Over-the-counter enquiry on class registration": "Hello. Can I help you? Yes, I hope so. I would like to register for Comp Lit 287. I'm sorry, but that class is already full. And also, students are supposed to register through the touch-tone registration system. I know. I already tried to register for it by phone, but the computer won't let me. That's because it's full. But I'm a new student here. I thought maybe there was some way I could get into the class. I thought I should come and talk to you in the department office. Well, I could put you on a waiting list. But that doesn't guarantee you will get into the class. What is your name? My name is Karen Huang. That's spelled H - U - A - N - G. Alright. And what is your major? I'm a comparative literature major. Wait a minute. You're a Comp Lit major? Yes, that's right. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't know you were one of our students. That's why I'm trying to get into Comp Lit 287. I know it's a required class. And Professor Cohen told me I need to take it. The university computer system saves extra places, in class 287 for comp lit students. I can give you a special code. When you register by phone, you can use the code to get into the class. Even if the class is full? That's right. Oh, I didn't know that. Sure. Here is the code number, with information on how to use it. Thank you. So you think I will be able to get in with this? Sure. Just call the touch-tone registration system again. Then, follow the directions on the sheet. You will get in no problem. Thanks. Next time you come in here, I will recognize you.",

My name is Judy Liao. That's spelled L I A O. Alright. . . And did you have some specific questions about your application? Not really. I was in the neighborhood, and I just wanted to stop in to see if you received my resume. Oh, that's no problem. Just give me a moment, and I can check. Judy Liao. Let's see. . . Yes, here it is. Judy Liao. We have received your resume. Thank you. Is there anything else I can help you with? Yes, maybe. The ad in the newspaper said you wanted the resume, a cover letter, and two letters of recommendation. I included those things in the envelope. Is there anything else I should send? No, that is all we need. If we have those things included, that is sufficient. Do you know when they will start setting up interviews for the job? I'm not really sure about that. But I know we are still receiving resumes. Maybe after a week or two they will start calling applicants. I see. Well, thank you very much for helping me. You have been very helpful. If you have any further questions, you can call any time. Thank you. Thank you. Goodbye.",
